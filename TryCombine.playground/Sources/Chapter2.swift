/*
 Publishers do not emit any values if there are no subscribers to potentially receive the output.
 
 A publisher can emit zero or more values but only one completion event, which can either be a normal completion event or an error.
 Once a publisher emits a completion event, itâ€™s finished and can no longer emit any more events.
 
 The sink operator will continue to receive as many values as the publisher emits.
